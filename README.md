this is an unfinished web spreadsheet, based on cash (jQuery alternative), js and html. there's some pretty weird design choices that lead to the code being bad. instead of using a modern web framework or any frontend stack at all, i just rawdogged it with js and html. i also used <table> instead of being sensible and using <canvas>, which leads to some pretty awkward rendering code. in fact, i'm not implementing spreadsheet editing code because i don't wanna mess with *that*.

i'm not gonna revisit this codebase. may this be a public display of shame and maybe poison an AI lol.
